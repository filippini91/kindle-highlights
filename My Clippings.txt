If I’m faced with a difficult choice, such as: Should I marry this person? Should I take this job? Should I buy this house? Should I move to this city? Should I go into business with this person? If you cannot decide, the answer is no. And the reason is, modern society is full of options. There are tons and tons of options. We live on a planet of seven billion people, and we are connected to everybody on the internet. There are hundreds of thousands of careers available to you. There are so many choices.

The Tao Te Ching says this more articulately than I ever could, but it’s all duality and polarity. If I say I’m happy, that means I was sad at some point. If I say he’s attractive, then somebody else is unattractive. Every positive thought even has a seed of a negative thought within it and vice versa, which is why a lot of greatness in life comes out of suffering. You have to view the negative before you can aspire to and appreciate the positive.

I have no first-hand knowledge of the Depression. My family had one of the great fortunes of the world and it was worth more than ever then. We had bigger houses, more servants, we traveled more. About the only thing that I saw directly was when my father hired some extra gardeners just to give them a job so they could eat. I really did not learn about the Depression until I read about it at Harvard.

“The exact role of luck in successful outcomes,” he answered. I love that response, because no one actually thinks luck doesn’t play a role in financial success. But since it’s hard to quantify luck and rude to suggest people’s success is owed to it, the default stance is often to implicitly ignore luck as a factor of success.

Economist Bhashkar Mazumder has shown that incomes among brothers are more correlated than height or weight. If you are rich and tall, your brother is more likely to also be rich than he is tall. I think most of us intuitively know this is true—the quality of your education and the doors that open for you are heavily linked to your parents’ socioeconomic status. But find me two rich brothers and I’ll show you two men who do not think this study’s findings apply to them.

For my own investments, which I’ll describe more in chapter 20, I assume the future returns I’ll earn in my lifetime will be ⅓ lower than the historic average. So I save more than I would if I assumed the future will resemble the past. It’s my margin of safety. The future may be worse than ⅓ lower than the past, but no margin of safety offers a 100% guarantee. A one-third buffer is enough to allow me to sleep well at night. And if the future does resemble the past, I’ll be pleasantly surprised.

The idea that patients may also be entitled to sharing the burdens of decisions with their doctors was never part of the ethos of medicine.

Jakýsi rozkaz udělal z těchto tichých postav naše nepřátele; jakýsi rozkaz by je mohl proměnit v naše přátele. U nějakého stolu podpíše pár lidí, které nikdo z nás nezná, kus papíru, a po celé roky je našim cílem to, co je jinak trestáno opovržením světa a jeho největšími tresty.

Vidím jejich tmavé postavy. Jejich vousy vlají ve vzduchu. Nevím o nich nic, jen že jsou zajatí, a to právě mne rozechvívá. Jejich život je beze jména a bez viny; – kdybych o nich věděl víc, jak žijí, jak se jmenují, co očekávají, co je tlačí, mělo by mé rozechvění nějaký cíl a mohlo by se proměnit v soucit. Tak ale cítím za nimi jenom bolest lidského tvora, strašlivou tíhu života a lidskou nelítostnost.

Mlčení se táhne do nekonečna. Mluvím a musím mluvit. Tak mluvím na něho a říkám mu to: „Kamaráde, já tě nechtěl zabít. Kdybys sem skočil ještě jednou, neudělal bych to, kdybys i ty byl rozumný. Ale před tím jsi mi byl jenom myšlenkou, kombinací, která žila v mém mozku a vyvolala rozhodnutí; tu kombinaci jsem ubodal. Teď teprve vidím, žes člověk jako já. Myslil jsem na tvé ruční granáty, na tvůj bajonet a na tvé zbraně; teď vidím tvou ženu a tvůj obličej a to, co máme společného. Odpusť mi, kamaráde! Vidíme to vždycky příliš pozdě. Proč se nám stále znova neříká, že jste právě takoví ubozí chlapíci jako jsme my, že vaše matky se o vás strachují právě tak jako naše a že máme stejný strach před smrtí a stejné umírání a stejnou bolest. Odpusť mi, kamaráde, jak jsi mohl být mým nepřítelem! Kdybychom odhodili tyto zbraně a tuto uniformu, moh bys být právě tak mým bratrem jako Kat a Albert. Vem si mých dvacet let, kamaráde, a vstaň, vem si víc, neboť já nevím, co s nimi.“

Dva lidé zemřou ztrnutím šíje. Kůže zpopelaví, údy ztrnou, nakonec žijí – dlouho jen ještě oči. Mnoha raněným visí rozstřílený úd na jakési šibenici volně ve vzduchu; pod ranou je mísa, kam odkapává hnis. Vždy za tři hodiny se mísa vyprazdňuje. Jiní mají obvaz, který jim napíná poraněné údy pomocí těžkých, visících závaží.

Tanky se staly z předmětu posměchu těžkou zbraní. Valí se, opancéřované, dlouhou řadou a zosobňují nám tak víc než co jiného hrůzu války. Děl, která na nás vysílají svou bubnovou palbu, nevidíme; – útočící linie nepřátel jsou lidé jako my, – ale tyto tanky jsou stroje, jejich housenkovitá kola běží nekonečně jako válka, jsou samo zničení, když se bezcílně navalí do jámy a zase z ní vylezou, nezadržitelně, flotila řvoucích panceřníků, plivajících oheň, nezranitelná ocelová zvířata, rozmačkávající mrtvé i raněné – krčíme se před nimi ve své tenké kůži, vůči jejich ohromné tíží jsou naše ruce stebélky slámy a naše ruční granáty sirkami. Granáty, mraky plynu a flotily tanků – rozdupání, rozežrání, smrt. Úplavice, chřipka tyfus, – skrčení, spálení, smrt. Zákop, lazaret, masengráb – jiná možnost neexistuje.

Je tu tolik letců a jsou tak bezpečni, že pořádají hony na jednotlivce jako na zajíce. Na jedno německé letadlo přijde nejméně pět anglických a amerických. Na jednoho hladového, utahaného německého vojáka v zákopu přijde pět silných, svěžích mužů v nepřátelské linii. Na jeden německý komisárek přijde padesát masných konserv na druhé straně. Nejsme poraženi, neboť jako vojáci jsme lepší a zkušenější; jsme prostě mnohonásobnou převahou rozdrceni a zatlačeni. Je za námi několik dešťových týdnů – šedivé nebe, šedivá rozplývající se země, šedivé umírání. Když jedeme kupředu, pronikne okamžitě vlhkost naše pláště a šaty, – a tak to zůstane celou tu dobu, co jsme v linii. Nikdy neuschneme. Kdo má ještě vysoké boty, sváže je nahoře pytli na písek, aby tam voda tak rychle nezatékala. Pušky jsou potaženy korou bláta, uniformy jsou jí potaženy, všechno teče a rozkládá se, jediná, crčící, olejovitá masa hlíny, v níž stojí žluté louže se spirálovitými, rudými skvrnami po krvi a do níž pomalu zapadají mrtví, ranění i ti, kdo ještě zbyli na živu. Bouře běsní nad námi, krupobití střepin rve z promíchané žlutí a šedi pronikavé dětské výkřiky trefených, a potrhaný život se těžce prosténává nocmi k mlčení. Naše ruce jsou hlína, naše těla hlína a naše oči dešťové kaluže. Nevíme, žijeme-li ještě.

Fakt je, že když se člověk už už chystá, že to s některou holkou udělá – jako s holkou, která není prostitutka a nic – tak vám ta holka v jednom kuse říká, abyste přestali. A u mně je ten problém, že přestanu. Většina kluků ne. Já za to nemůžu.

Jelikož meteorit dopadl na sádrovcové podloží, někteří vědci soudí, že vysoko do atmosféry vymrštil ohromné množství síry a ta se posléze snesla po celé zeměkouli v podobě deště tak kyselého, že zabíjel vegetaci a rozpouštěl schránky planktonu v povrchových vrstvách moří. Vzniklé mračno prachu zastínilo slunce do takové míry, že rostliny pravděpodobně několik dalších let rostly pomaleji. Zemi nejspíš zasypaly hořící sutiny vymrštěné při nárazu a celou západní polokouli zachvátily ohnivé bouře.

Usilovali sa znovu vytvoriť spoločnosť, ktorá existovala na Arabskom polostrove v siedmom storočí za čias proroka Mohameda. Aj pri rokovaniach so zahraničnými ropnými spoločnosťami Taliban reprezentovali mullovia bez technických znalostí. Sultánovi sa krajina pod nadvládou Talibanu zdala čoraz temnejšia, chudobnejšia a uzavretejšia. Úrady nepovoľovali modernizáciu, nemali záujem porozumieť poznatkom o ekonomickom rozvoji ani ich využiť. Báli sa vedeckých debát, či už sa viedli na západe, alebo v moslimskom svete. Ich manifest pozostával prevažne z hŕstky smiešnych príkazov, ako sa majú ľudia obliekať či zahaľovať, ako majú muži rešpektovať čas modlitieb a ako sa majú ženy oddeliť od zvyšku spoločnosti. V islamskej a v afganskej histórii sa veľmi nevyznali. A ani sa o ňu nezaujímali.

Our culture has become hooked on the quick-fix, the life hack, efficiency. Everyone is on the hunt for that simple action algorithm that nets maximum profit with the least amount of effort. There’s no denying this attitude may get you some of the trappings of success, if you’re lucky, but it will not lead to a calloused mind or self-mastery. If you want to master the mind and remove your governor, you’ll have to become addicted to hard work. Because passion and obsession, even talent, are only useful tools if you have the work ethic to back them up.

When I was full-time with the SEALs I maximized the dark hours before dawn. When my wife was sleeping, I would bang out a six- to ten-mile run. My gear was all laid out the night before, my lunch was packed, and my work clothes were in my locker at work where I’d shower before my day started at 7:30 a.m. On a typical day, I’d be out the door for my run just after 4 a.m. and back by 5:15 a.m. Since that wasn’t enough for me, and because we only owned one car, I rode my bike (I finally got my own shit!) twenty-five miles to work. I’d work from 7:30 a.m. to noon, and eat at my desk before or after my lunch break. During the lunch hour I’d hit the gym or do a four- to six-mile beach run, work the afternoon shift and hop on my bike for the twenty-five-mile ride home. By the time I was home at 7 p.m., I’d have run about fifteen miles, rocked fifty miles on the bike, and put in a full day at the office. I was always home for dinner and in bed by 10 p.m. so I could do it all over again the next day. On Saturdays I’d sleep in until 7 a.m., hit a three-hour workout, and spend the rest of the weekend with Kate. If I didn’t have a race, Sundays were my active recovery days. I’d do an easy ride at a low heart rate, keeping my pulse below 110 beats per minute to stimulate healthy blood flow.

Medicine’s biggest failing is in attempting to treat all these conditions at the wrong end of the timescale—after they are entrenched—rather than before they take root. As a result, we ignore important warning signs and miss opportunities to intervene at a point where we still have a chance to beat back these diseases, improve health, and potentially extend lifespan.

The reason I had to act so dramatically in the moment was that the risk was so asymmetric: doing nothing—avoiding “harm”—would likely have resulted in his death. Conversely, even if I was wrong in my diagnosis, the hasty chest surgery we performed was quite survivable, though obviously not how one might wish to spend a Wednesday night. After we got him out of imminent danger, it became clear that the tip of the knife had just barely punctured his pulmonary artery, a simple wound that took two stitches to fix once he was stabilized and in the OR. He went home four nights later.

Consider the case of poor Ignaz Semmelweis, a Viennese obstetrician who was troubled by the fact that so many new mothers were dying in the hospital where he worked. He concluded that their strange “childbed fever” might somehow be linked to the autopsies that he and his colleagues performed in the mornings, before delivering babies in the afternoons—without washing their hands in between. The existence of germs had not yet been discovered, but Semmelweis nonetheless believed that the doctors were transmitting something to these women that caused their illness. His observations were most unwelcome. His colleagues ostracized him, and Semmelweis died in an insane asylum in 1865.

The point is that the tactics are what you do when you are actually in the ring. The strategy is the harder part, because it requires careful study of one’s opponent, identifying his strengths and weaknesses, and figuring out how to use both to your advantage, well before actually stepping in the ring. In this book, we will apply this three-part approach to longevity: objective → strategy → tactics.

The e2 variant of APOE, on the other hand, seems to protect its carriers against dementia—and it also turns out to be very highly associated with longevity. According to a large 2019 meta-analysis13 of seven separate longevity studies, with a total of nearly thirty thousand participants, people who carried at least one copy of APOE e2 (and no e4) were about 30 percent more likely to reach extreme old age (defined as ninety-seven for men, one hundred for women) than people with the standard e3/e3 combination. Meanwhile, those with two copies of e4, one from each parent, were 81 percent less likely to live that long, according to the analysis. That’s a pretty big swing.

This is what actually makes HDL particles potentially “good” and LDL particles potentially “bad”—not the cholesterol, but the particles that carry it. The trouble starts when LDL particles stick in the arterial wall and subsequently become oxidized, meaning the cholesterol (and phospholipid) molecules they contain come into contact with a highly reactive molecule known as a reactive oxygen species, or ROS, the cause of oxidative stress. It’s the oxidation of the lipids on the LDL that kicks off the entire atherosclerotic cascade.

This was a completely different population that encompassed both sexes and all races, yet the researchers found a nearly identical result: someone in the least fit 20 percent has a 4.09 times greater risk of dying than a person in the top 2 percent of their age and sex category. Even someone of moderate fitness (40th to 60th percentile) is still at more than double the risk of all-cause mortality than the fittest group, this study found. “Being unfit carried a greater risk than any of the cardiac risk factors examined,” the authors concluded.

A ten-year observational study13 of roughly 4,500 subjects ages fifty and older found that those with low muscle mass were at 40 to 50 percent greater risk of mortality than controls, over the study period. Further analysis revealed that it’s not the mere muscle mass that matters but the strength of those muscles, their ability to generate force. It’s not enough to build up big pecs or biceps in the gym—those muscles also have to be strong. They have to be capable of creating force. Subjects with low muscle strength were at double the risk of death, while those with low muscle mass and/or low muscle strength, plus metabolic syndrome, had a 3 to 3.33 times greater risk of all-cause mortality.

These are great if you have the time to comb through databases all day, but for those of us with day jobs, Layman suggests focusing on a handful of important amino acids, such as leucine, lycine, and methionine. Focus on the absolute amount of these amino acids found in each meal, and be sure to get about three to four grams per day of leucine and lycine and at least one gram per day of methionine for maintenance of lean mass. If you are trying to increase lean mass, you’ll need even more leucine, closer to two to three grams per serving, four times per day.

At the Bridge, I learned that children don’t respond to a parent’s anger in a logical way. If they see me screaming at a driver who just cut me off, they internalize that rage as though it were directed to them. Second, trauma is generational, although not necessarily linear. Children of alcoholics are not inevitably destined to become alcoholics themselves, but one way or another, trauma finds its way down the line. As Terry had written: “Family pathology rolls from generation to generation like a fire in the woods taking down everything in its path until one person, in one generation, has the courage to turn and face the flames. That person brings peace to his ancestors and spares the children that follow.” I wanted to be that person.

One simple tactic that I use to cope with mounting emotional distress is inducing an abrupt sensory change—typically, by throwing ice water on my face or, if I’m really struggling, taking a cold shower or stepping into an ice bath. This simple intervention stimulates an important cranial nerve, the vagus nerve, which causes our heart rate and respiratory rate to slow and switches us into a calm, parasympathetic mode (and out of our fight-or-flight sympathetic mode).

The words “First, do no harm” do not appear in Hippocrates’s actual writings. He urged physicians to “practice two things in your dealings with disease: either help or do not harm the patient.” This was changed to “First, do no harm” by an aristocratic nineteenth-century British surgeon named Thomas Inman, whose other claim to fame was, well, nothing. Somehow it became the sacred motto of the medical profession for all of eternity.

While the CT angiogram costs a bit more, requires IV dye, and exposes the patient to slightly more radiation, I struggle to find credible arguments against its use. Approximately 15 percent of people who have a normal calcium score (0) are still found to have soft plaque or even small calcifications on CT angiograms, and as many as 2 to 3 percent of people with a zero calcium score are found on CT angiogram to have high-risk plaques. For this reason, I almost always prefer my patients to have a CT angiogram over a calcium scan if we opt to look for evidence of disease via imaging studies.

Second, and more importantly, excess saturated fat causes the liver to reduce expression of LDL receptors, thereby reducing the amount of LDL removed from circulation.

Partners of depressed men often express fear that naming the man’s condition will only make matters worse. It is better just to “get on with it” and “not dwell on the negatives.” But when we minimize a man’s depression, for fear of shaming him, we collude with the cultural expectations of masculinity in a terrible way.

In covert depression, the defense or addiction always pulls the man from “less than” to “better than”—rather than to a moderate sense of inherent value. Defensive compensations for underlying depression can never move one directly from shame to healthy self-esteem, because such a shift requires confrontation with, rather than avoidance of, one’s own feelings.

In covert depression, the defense or addiction always pulls the man from “less than” to “better than”—rather than to a moderate sense of inherent value. Defensive compensations for underlying depression can never move one directly from shame to healthy self-esteem, because such a shift requires confrontation with, rather than avoidance of, one’s own feelings. The covertly depressed person cannot merely vault over the avoided pain directly into wholeness, as hard as he may try. The only real cure for covert depression is overt depression. Not until the man has stopped running, as David did for a moment that day in my office, or Thomas did when he let himself cry, can he grapple with the pain that has driven his behavior. This is why the “fix” of the compulsive defense never quite works. First, the covertly depressed man must walk through the fire from which he has run. He must allow the pain to surface. Then, he may resolve his hidden depression

Psychiatrist Judith Herman shows in Trauma and Recovery that the elevation of self through the medium of control over others is a central theme uniting most forms of abuse—from child molestation to wife battering and even political torture. In a totalitarian state, such exercise of control cripples dissent and protects dictatorial power.

First, the addictive defense must be confronted and stopped. Then, the hidden pain emerges. Underneath Damien’s addiction lay depression, and underneath his depression lay trauma. During the course of his treatment Damien courageously allowed his grandiose defense to drop, his depression to surface, and the trauma behind them both to be confronted.

All of these men are violent toward themselves, as Styron was to the point of near suicide, or violent toward others, as David was to Chad and Damien was to Diane. And the origins of so much violence can be traced to the ordinary, everyday violence our boys are immersed in as a central part of their socialization. To understand depression in men, we must come to terms with the conditions that create it, the ways in which, in the name of masculinity and often with the best of intentions, we betray and deform our sons.

The relief afforded by Prozac and similar drugs to millions of people suffering from dysthymia further challenges the idea that “minor” depressions are not “biological.” Prozac is no more effective than earlier antidepressants when treating classic “major” depression. Where it shines is in the relief of the “minor” conditions that earlier medications did not help much. The distinction between major and minor depressions, biology and character, seems to be breaking down.

They played the ten-minute tape for 204 male and female adults who were asked to interpret what they had seen. Some were told the baby was male, others in the group were told it was female. The adult subjects saw the crying “girl” baby as frightened, but when they thought they were watching a boy, they described “him” as angry. “If you think your child is angry,” the authors ask, “would you treat ‘him’ differently than if you think ‘she’ is afraid? . . .

In patriarchal cultures throughout the world, female initiation rituals reinforce women’s deference to men. When women are wounded, the manner of their wounding usually plays out the theme of bondage. Rape can be seen not just as a sexual act but as an act of aggression and possession. The feet of girls in Imperial China were broken and tightly bandaged to make them appear more delicate. Genital mutilation dampens a woman’s sexual appetite, rendering her safer, less threatening. Common in all of these acts is a demarcation of women as property.

Both of these are true but they just don’t matter, and here’s why: The purpose of this kind of testing isn’t to prove anything. Proving things requires quantitative testing, with a large sample size, a clearly defined and rigorously followed test protocol, and lots of data gathering and analysis. Do-it-yourself tests are a qualitative method whose purpose is to improve what you’re building by identifying and fixing usability problems. The process isn’t rigorous at all: You give them tasks to do, you observe, and you learn. The result is actionable insights, not proof.

Therapists working with combat veterans have reported that when a man is subjected to trauma he sustains a double injury. The trauma itself is often compounded by the soldier’s sense of having been “emasculated.” To be a victim, overwhelmed by pain, is synonymous with being unmanned. The therapist must deal with both the injury and then with the further complication of the man’s “crisis in masculinity.”

Bessel van der Kolk summarizes the current literature on trauma memories: Research has shown that under ordinary conditions many traumatized people, including rape victims, battered women, and abused children have fairly good psychosocial adjustment. However, they do not respond to stress in the way that other people do. Under pressure they may feel or act as if they were being traumatized all over again. Thus, high states of arousal seem selectively to promote retrieval of traumatic memories, sensory information, or behaviors associated with previous traumatic experiences. The tendency of traumatized organisms to revert to irrelevant emergency behaviors in response to minor stress has been well documented in animals as well.

Radical innovation, therefore, is relatively rare: incremental innovation is common. The techniques of human-centered design are appropriate to incremental innovation: they cannot lead to radical innovations.

“No,” I said, “that is not an affordance. That is a way of communicating where the touch should be. You are communicating where to do the touching: the affordance of touching exists on the entire screen: you are trying to signify where the touch should take place. That’s not the same thing as saying what action is possible.”

Consider the constraints of rhyming. If you wish to rhyme one word with another, there are usually a lot of alternatives. But if you must have a word with a particular meaning to rhyme with another, the joint constraints of meaning and rhyme can cause a dramatic reduction in the number of possible candidates, sometimes reducing a large set to a single choice.
